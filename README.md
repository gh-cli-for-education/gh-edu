[WIP]

## Working with this version of gh-edu

1. Install
  
  ```
  gh extension install gh-cli-for-education/gh-edu
  ```
2. Move to the instalation folder and create and change to local branch `js`:

  ```
  cd ~/.local/share/gh/gh-edu
  git checkout -b js origin/js
  ```

3. Copy your previously saved config file onto the installation folder

  ```
  cp config.old.json ~/.local/share/gh/extensions/gh-edu/config.json
  ```

4. Use only plugins extensions compatible with this version (plugin branch `js`):

  ```
  âžœ  gh-edu git:(js) gh edu-data team
  Warning: 2 members in this team. Skip
  ...
  [ ... ] 
  ``` 

## Keep in mind
As plugins artists you have total freedom to develop the extension as you want.
But for consistency's sake keep in mind the next points:

To load the configuration file you can add this code (js/ts)
```js
/** Load configuration */
import fs from 'fs'
const stringConfig = fs.readFileSync(process.cwd() + "/../gh-edu/config.json", { encoding: "utf8", flag: "r" })
const config = JSON.parse(stringConfig);
/** END loadConfig */
```
More solutions will be available for diferents languages

- ``-f, --force`` will not ask for user input.
- The options ``-s, --silence``, will mute log information and user input.
These options have been designed with scripting in mind.
Output results and errors ignore these flags.
